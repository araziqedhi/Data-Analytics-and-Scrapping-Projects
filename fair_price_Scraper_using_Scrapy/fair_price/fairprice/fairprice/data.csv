At the end of each month, the donated Linkpoints will be converted to the equivalent monetary amount and disbursed to the beneficiary organisations. ,Rewards on the FairPrice Group app,This latest functionality which allows users to donate Linkpoints with ease, and builds on the “Rewards” feature, was launched early this year. “Rewards” on the FPG app has provided members with more ways to use their Linkpoints – to get instant savings and better value on their rewards.,In 2022, FPG continued to support FBSG and FFTH through the donation of unsold food worth S$243,000.

Singapore’s largest retailer marked its 50th anniversary celebrations with the launch of a brand campaign to honour its frontliners and highlight the role that FPG has played in securing the nation’s food supply through thick and thin. ,The FPG love letter which ran across all four languages of Singapore Press Holding’s main vernacular dailies promises to safeguard its customers’ way of life in Singapore. Conceptualised and developed together with The Secret Little Agency (TSLA), FPG’s campaign theme is ‘Always, FairPrice’.,Alvin Neo, Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, FairPrice Group said that the campaign was developed at a time where Singapore is facing its highest rate of inflation in 14 years. “Our love letter to all in Singapore aims to assure customers that through economic highs and lows, good times and tough ones; FPG will remain focused on moderating the cost of living by setting the benchmark for prices of daily staples, so as to keep food and essentials within reach and readily available.

This was done to strengthen its ability to provide affordable cooked food, thereby furthering its social mission of moderating the cost of living. ,In addition, under the FPG umbrella, it now has pharmacies, Singapore’s largest coalition rewards programme (NTUC Link) and Grocery Logistics Singapore (GLS), a logistics and supply chain solutions provider to the fast moving consumer goods segment. ,With its eye on shaping the future of retail, FPG has also invested in its omni-channel capabilities to provide customers with more convenience and hyper-personalised offers and discounts for everything food – from grocery shopping to paying for meals at its kopitiams. The popular FairPrice Group app is now used by more than 1 million customers every month. ,“From the day we were founded, our mission has been unchanging: to moderate the cost of living and make every day a little better. FairPrice Group has journeyed with our customers and in many ways, our story mirrors that of Singapore’s economic progress. We have risen to the challenge in delivering consistent quality and convenience for our customers, not just through groceries and food services, but also stayed relevant through strategic digital transformation. Our 50th anniversary campaign embodies that spirit of assurance. ” Alvin added.,With its FPG50 celebrations, the public can look forward to the launch of a nationwide ‘behind-the-scenes’ video quiz series which features real life stories of frontliners working around the clock to deliver daily essentials to all in Singapore. The public can view the series at the FPG50 anniversary microsite- ,fairpricegroup.com.sg/fpg50, starting from Monday, 15 May 2023 with new episodes released weekly through to 17 July, tied to an online challenge with up to $50,000 worth of FairPrice eVouchers to be won.,In addition, the FPG50 brand campaign’s creative direction features re-created miniatures of FairPrice Group employees visually representing every little effort that the FairPrice takes to ensure that it stays true to the promise of safeguarding the way of life, where essential products such as eggs take centre stage.
